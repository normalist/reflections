When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I work with others, I'll use a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I'll choose manually. If I others update Github and automatically update my local directory.
    I can't work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    I'll use fork when I need a source from github.com
    I'll use clone when I need a download source
    I'll use branch when I need a develop special feature in my local directory

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    My source will be keep updated last known status and there would be not much difference with my version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I didn't know Gtihub is handy. I'll not work othere without Git or Github.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I'll use branch when I got more experince with Github. 

Adding a Remote
	Create repository on github.com
	git remote (check current remote)
	git remote add origin [url]
	git remote -v
	git push origin master
	(you may login to github

Pulling Changes
	git pull origin master

Fork, Clone, Branch 

git clone https://github.com/normalist/recipes.git

git pull origin master = git fetch origin
                         git merge master origin/master

git fetch [bookmark]  Downloads all history from the repository bookmark

Fast-Forward Merge when you merge two commits, where one is ancestor of the other 

git btanch different-oil
git checkout different-oil
git add cake-recipe.txt
git push origin different-oil

bash sarah_changes_2.sh https://github.com/normalist/recipes.git
